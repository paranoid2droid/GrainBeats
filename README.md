## Introduction

![Panel](panel.png)

The magic part is on the right part of the panel. 

When you turn on the "Bad Timing!!!" button, the digital clock triggering the beats will be modulated corresponding to the parameters below. Plus, you can modify the modulating frequency, modulating amount, and you can even give the modulation a swing.

You can bang the drums directly hit the "BANG!!!" button, it triggers the beats cooperating with modulation. Thus, different sounds would be generated by different parameters.

BTW, **try it hard**, and you will get the best damn groove.
